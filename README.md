Software plays a central role in all aspects of electrical and computer engineering. This course will provide the foundation for effectively using software as a key part of a career as a professional electrical or computer engineer. Fundamentals of software development systems: system languages, high-level object-oriented languages, and computational languages. Data structures and algorithms in problem analysis and design. Strategies for designing software and designing with software. Software design and development: methodologies, principles and practice. Formalizing software: management, requirements, specifications, testing. Survey of software applications in ECE, including real-time systems, the web, networked systems, audio, graphics, and video systems, research and engineering analysis, consumer electronics and computing, instrumentation and measurement, design, modeling, prototyping, simulation, optimization and information analysis. Students can choose projects and assignments with application to/inspired by/drawn from a broad array of ECE fields including the traditional areas of electro-physics/photonics, computer engineering, and information and data science.
